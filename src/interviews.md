# Mock Interviews

Each week throughout the semester, an "interview question of the week" will be distributed. These interview questions are similar to what you might encounter during coding interviews for software development jobs. Our goal with these questions is to help prepare you for technical interviews in the software industry.

## Weeks 1-2: sample interviews

During the first two weeks of the semester, special sessions will be held, in which the instructor will perform a mock interview with a student. These special sessions are separate from the regular class meeting and are optional. However, the goal of them is to provide you with some experience and expectations for the routine of a technical interview.

The instructor will seek out volunteers to be the interviewees for these special sessions. A small amount of extra credit will be given to the students selected for their participation.

## Weeks 3-8: peer interviews

During weeks 3 and 4 of the semester, the class will be split into two pools of students, Pool A and Pool B. Each student in Pool A will be paired with a student in Pool B.

During this two-week period, you and your partner should conduct two 30 minute interviews, in which you are each once the interviewer and once the interviewee.

Each week, an "Interview Question of the Week" guide will be distributed via Google Drive to either Pool A or Pool B. The guide will contain all of the information needed to conduct an interview, including general instructions, a coding question, a sample solution, and proposed follow-up questions.

After the interview is completed, both partners will be asked to submit a reflection about their experience.

We will assign new partners in weeks 5-6, and then again in weeks 7-8.

Overall, by the end the course, you will have:

* Interviewed three different peers
* Been interviewed by three different peers
* Submitted **6 mock interview reflections**

## Resources

For all interviews, you should make sure you have read and are familiar with the [interview instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVr0HgCoI_0uhFR9U0MkY7lXQxfRQptx5fHWK-wWSLU/edit#).

## Grading

The mock interviews will contribute 15% to your overall grade. This grade is based on 

1) completion of all six interviews, 
2) your reflections submitted for each interview.

You can find and submit the interview reflection in Gradescope.

## FAQs

1. **In what setting will the interview take place?**

The interview can take place as an online meeting. Meeting in person is not necessary, but is allowed if both partners agree.

2. **What happens if I'm unable to complete an interview in a given week?**

There are opportunities for makeup interviews throughout the semester.

3. **What happens if my partner is unable to participate in an interview for a given week?**

You can either do a makeup interview later in the semester, or find another peer who is willing to conduct the interview with you during the week (only in cases where your partner is the interviewer).

4. **I don't feel confident in my coding skills, and I'm afraid I won't do well during the mock interview.**

In this class (and often in the real world), you are not strictly judged on your ability to produce a bug-free, highly efficient implementation of an algorithm. You are mostly judged on your thinking process and ability to work your way through the problem. 

For the mock interivews, you will not be graded on the correctness of your solution, and will earn full credit as long as you complete the interview and submit a thoughtful reflection.

Also: we are here to learn! We are doing this process to give you experience interviewing, so that when you go to do a real interview, you already have some interview experience. We should all be mindful of this and help and encourage each other.

5. **My partner was unprepared for the interview and it hurt my experience. What can I do?**

This is something you should discuss in your submitted reflection. Everyone should come prepared to every interview. Even though these are mock interviews, they are being conducted to help each other gain experience in this important part of becoming a software developer, and being unprepared will diminish this experience for your partner.

6. **As the interviewee, can I see the solution before I attempt the mock interview?**

Please do not seek out the interview question or solution before attempting the interview. If you do, you will not get the full benefit of the exercise, which will only hurt your interviewing skills in the long run.

7. **How do I volunteer to be interviewed during weeks 1 and 2?**

The instructor will provide information about finding volunteers at the start of the term.

8. **Does the interview have to last the full 30 minutes?**

No, but it should last at least 20 minutes, and ideally 25-30 minutes.

9. **I have another question about the mock interviews. Who can I ask?**

You can ask in the class Discord, or email the instructor directly.
