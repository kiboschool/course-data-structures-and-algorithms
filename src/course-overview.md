# Course Overview

**CSF006** | *6 ECTS Credits*

## Welcome to Data Structures and Algorithms!

## Course Description

This course teaches the fundamentals of data structures and introduces students to the implementation and analysis of algorithms.  

Students start by examining the basic linear data structures: linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues. They learn how to build these structures from scratch, represent algorithms using pseudocode, and translate algorithms into running programs. They apply these algorithms to real-life applications to understand complexity and performance tradeoffs. Students will also learn how to develop algorithms for sorting and searching, use iteration and recursion for repetition, and make tradeoffs between the approaches. They will learn to estimate the efficiency of algorithms, and practice writing and refining algorithms in Python.  

This course emphasizes big-picture understanding and practical problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews and professional practice. Throughout the course, students will solve common practice problems, and participate in mock interview sessions. As part of their formative assessments, they will also deepen their understanding of these topics and practice technical communication by writing technical blog posts.
