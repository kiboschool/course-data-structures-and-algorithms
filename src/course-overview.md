## Course Description

This course teaches the fundamentals of data structures and introduces students to the implementation and analysis of algorithms.  

Students start by examining the basic linear data structures: linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues. They learn how to build these structures from scratch, represent algorithms using pseudocode, and translate algorithms into running programs. They apply these algorithms to real-life applications to understand complexity and performance tradeoffs. Students will also learn how to develop algorithms for sorting and searching, use iteration and recursion for repetition, and make tradeoffs between the approaches. They will learn to estimate the efficiency of algorithms, and practice writing and refining algorithms in Python.  

This course emphasizes big-picture understanding and practical problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews and professional practice. Throughout the course, students will solve common practice problems, and participate in mock interview sessions. As part of their formative assessments, they will also deepen their understanding of these topics and practice technical communication by writing technical blog posts.

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Answer practice exercises to try out the concepts
- Complete assignments and projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.

## Assessments

* Assignments: 40%
* Midterm Project: 20%
* Final Project: 25%
* Mock Interviews: 15%

## Important Notes

- Our main communication tool is Discord. You are fully responsible for checking Discord for announcements and updates.
- You are expected to attend all classes. If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up on the material.
- You are expected to complete all assignments on time. However, we also understand that circumstances may arise that require you to submit assignments late. Check the [late submission policy](assessments.md#late-policy) for information on how late assignments are handled.
- Cheating is not tolerated. If you are caught cheating, you will be given a zero for the assignment and you will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee. Make sure you are familiar with the [Kibo School Academic Integrity Policy](assessments.md#academic-integrity). You are expected to follow the policy in all your work.
- Make sure you check the [Getting help](asking-for-help.md) for information on how to get help with the course.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
  programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
  Python to try out your code and test that it works.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
