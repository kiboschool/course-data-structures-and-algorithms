# Recursion I 

Welcome to week 3! Watch the video below to get an overview of the coming week.

> VIDEO. Insert 1-2 minute video giving an overview of week 2.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Implement algorithms using recursion
- Visualize the execution of a recursive algorithm
- Compute the time and space complexities of recursive algorithms
- Compare and contrast recursive and iterative versions of the same algorithm

## What's due this week

- Nothing! Take this opportunity to catch up on any concepts covered in the first three weeks of the course, as well as complete an interview of the week question.
