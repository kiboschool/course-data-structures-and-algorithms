## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Categorize algorithms according to their big-O efficiency classes
- Compose algorithms that search efficiently through sorted data
- Analyze worst case and best case behavior of algorithms
- Trace the execution of sorting algorithms
- Derive the efficiency of algorithms experimentally

## What's due this week
