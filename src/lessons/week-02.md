Welcome to week 2! Watch the video below to get an overview of the coming week.

> VIDEO. Insert 1-2 minute video giving an overview of week 2.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Categorize algorithms according to their big-O efficiency classes
- Compose algorithms that search efficiently through sorted data
- Analyze worst case and best case behavior of algorithms
- Trace the execution of sorting algorithms
- Derive the efficiency of algorithms experimentally
