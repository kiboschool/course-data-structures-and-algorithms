## Using Trees for Compression

This week you learned about working with trees. In this assignment, you'll use trees to solve a practical problem: compressing and decompressing files.

You will create a program to compress and decompress files using a Huffman tree. You will construct a Huffman tree based on the characters in the file, then use it to compress a document and store it. You will then write the code to decompress the file using the Huffman tree from the encoding step. The program will output the amount of space saved using the compression algorithm.
