# Interviewing

As we round out our first week together, let's highlight one more goal for this term: gaining the skills and experience needed to be successful in technical interviews.

A common practice in the tech industry is to conduct a coding interview as a part of the overall application process for software engineering and other computer science-related roles. In these interviews, a candidate is given a computational problem to solve, and is asked to code a solution in real time while the interviewer observes. This is quite different from a typical behavioral interview, and can be intimidating to those looking to enter the industry for the first time.

This course is the perfect opportunity to hone interviewing skills because most of the questions posed in these coding interviews are based on data structures and algorithms.

Watch the following video about the coding interview process at Google. Take note of how often data structures and algorithms are mentioned!

Throughout this term, you will progressively learn the skills you need to succeed in interviews, and practice those skills in mock interviews.
