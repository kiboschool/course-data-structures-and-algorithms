## Why practice?

Practice coding helps you become a great coder. These practice problems aren't
graded, but that doesn't mean they aren't important.

You should aim to practice a lot, especially with unfamiliar concepts. Spread practice over multiple days to take advantage of the _spacing effect_, which helps you retain new knowledge.

Practice helps you understand what you know, and what you don't know. It can be easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand something when you
do not -- or that you don't understand when you do. Practicing by writing code
or debugging code will help you find out what you really understand, and where
you are still confused.

Practice helps build confidence in your coding. The more programs you write, and
the more problems you solve, the more you learn that you are a capable coder and
problem-solver.

Practice doesn't always feel good - sometimes you'll be stumped! But, practice
shouldn't feel super frustrating either. If you find yourself getting angry at
yourself or the code, it's a good time to take a break and ask for help. 

The **solutions** to each challenge are available, and you can view a video of the solution below each challenge.

* Try to go through the whole challenge without using the solution.
* If you canâ€™t do the challenge without looking the solution, it means you donâ€™t understand the material well enough yet.
* Try the next practice challenges without looking at the solution. If you need more practice challenges, reach out on Discord.

## 2. Working with units of space and time

A photographer has a collection of 10,500 photos. She learns from her camera's manual that each photograph taken by the camera is 2.5 MB. Each photo also has 250 KB of metadata that needs to be stored alongside the photo. She currently has the photos in a cloud storage account that allows her to have 100 GB of data. However, she is worried that she might be reaching the limit of the account and is considering storing the collection on her local computer instead.

1. How close is the photographer to filling up her cloud storage account?

2. The photographer's computer has 40 GB of available disk space. What percentage of her collection would she be able to store on her computer?

3. The photographer learns that it takes 2000 ms to download each photo from the cloud storage account to her computer. At that speed, how many minutes would it take to download the entire collection?

4. The photographer also learns that her Internet uplink speed is 512 Kbps. Approximately how long would it take for her to upload 10 photos to her cloud storage account?

5. After reading the documentation of her editing software, the photographer finds that the software can comfortably accomodate 0.25 GiB of photo data in main memory at a time, and doesn't need to take into account the metadata associated with the photos. Approximately how many photos can she edit simultaneously?
