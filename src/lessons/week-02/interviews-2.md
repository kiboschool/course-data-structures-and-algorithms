# Week 2 Interviews

During the first two weeks of the term, two special sessions will be held in which the instructor will perform an
interview with a student. These special sessions are separate from the regular class meeting and are optional. However,
the goal of them is to provide you with some experience and expectations for the routine of a technical interview.

The instructor will seek out volunteers to be the interviewees for these special sessions.
