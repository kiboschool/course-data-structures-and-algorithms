## Implementing and Analyzing Sorting Algorithms

This week we learned about how to sort collections of data using various algorithms. We also learned how to analyze the efficiency of these algorithms using big-O notation.

In this assignment, you will analyze an unnamed sorting algorithm by counting the number of operations the sorting algorithm makes. You will then take those measurements and use them to derive the big-O notations of the algorithm under different conditions. Finally, you will implement radix sort and analyze it empirically as well.
