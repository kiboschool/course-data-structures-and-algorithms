# Selection Sort

The first sorting algorithm that we will learn is *selection sort*. Watch the following video to learn how the algorithm works.

> Note: the end of the video discusses the *big-O notation* of selection sort. We haven't learned what this is yet -- but don't fret, it's coming next!

In summary, to sort a list selection sort performs the following steps:

1. Find the minimum element in the list.
2. Swap the minimum element in the list with the element at index 0. The minimum element is now in its final sorted position.
3. Find the minimum element in the remaining portion of the list (starting from index 1).
4. Swap this element with the element at index 1. The second-to-minimum element is now in its final sorted position.
5. Continue finding the next-minimum element in the remaining portions of the list until you have swapped all elements into their final sorted positions.

<p>After the third pass of the selection sort algorithm, a list looks like this: `[20, 38, 44, 90, 77, 45, 81]`. After the *fourth* pass of selection sort, what will the list look like?</p>

<p><b>Answer.</b>The fourth iteration of selection sort will look for the minimum element starting from index 3 in the list. In the unsorted portion of the list, 45 is the minimum element. Therefore, it will be swapped with the element at index 3, making this list: <code>[20, 38, 44, 45, 77, 90, 81]</code>.</p>

Let's now think about how we could implement this algorithm in Python.

## Swapping elements

As you can see, a key part of selection sort is *swapping* elements. How can we accomplish that in Python?

Let's try defining the `swap()` function to swap two elements in a list. We'll make use of a variable `temp` to allow the swap to happen without overwriting one of the element's values before we can use it:

```python
def swap(elem1, elem2):
    temp = elem1
    elem1 = elem2
    elem2 = temp

lst = [5, 8, 2, 1, 9]
swap(lst[0], lst[3])
print(lst)
```

As you can see, we will need to take a slightly different approach. Here's a second, improved version of the `swap()` function:

```python
def swap(lst, i, j):
    temp = lst[i]
    lst[i] = lst[j]
    lst[j] = temp

lst = [5, 8, 2, 1, 9]
swap(lst[0], lst[3])
print(lst)
```

## Selection sort in Python

Let's see how we can use the `swap()` function to implement selection sort in Python:

## Counting comparisons and moves

Here again is the code for selection sort:

```python
def index_smallest(lst, start):
    index_min = start
    for i in range(start + 1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < lst[index_min]:
            index_min = i
    return index_min

def selection_sort(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        j = index_smallest(lst, i)
        swap(lst, i, j)
```

Let's try counting the number of comparisons `C(n)` that selection sort makes for a list of size `n`. To sort a list of `n` elements, selection sort performs `n - 1` passes over the list.

* On the first pass, it performs `n - 1` comparisons to find the smallest element.
* On the second pass, it performs `n - 2` comparisons to find the smallest element.
* ...
* On the `n - 1`st pass, it performs 1 comparison to find the smallest element.

If you sum the comparisons across all of these passes, you would get:

`C(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 3) + (n - 2) + (n - 1)`

This is actually a well-known arithmetic sequence that has a closed form solution:

> Insert image showing sum is equal to n(n-1)/2.

This means that selection sort always performs exactly `n^2/2 - n/2` comparisons for a list of size `n`.

What about the number of moves? Well again we know that selection sort performs `n - 1` passes, during each of which it performs one `swap()` operation. The `swap()` function performs three moves, meaning that selection sort always performs exactly `3n - 3` moves.

We now have measurements to ground our analysis of selection sort's running time! But what do we do with this information? In the next lesson, we will learn about *big-O notation* -- a formalism for defining the efficiency class of algorithms by focusing on the largest term of our measurements.
