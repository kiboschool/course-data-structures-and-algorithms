# Reading

Read the selection sort and insertion sort sections of Chapter 3 of [An Open Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://pressbooks.palni.org/anopenguidetodatastructuresandalgorithms/chapter/sorting/). You don't need to read the sections about merge sort or quicksort, as we'll cover those topics later.
