## Full Text Search with an Inverted Index

Throughout the course, you've learned a lot about using data structures and algorithms to solve problems.

For your final project, you will build full-text search using an inverted index. The program will read in a collection of documents and build an inverted index that maps words to a set of documents. The result of a search query for a word will show the top k documents, prioritized by the number of times that word occurs in the document.
