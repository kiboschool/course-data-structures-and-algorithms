# Midterm Preparation

We will have our midterm on Thursday, February 15 at 6:00 PM GMT. Here are the details:

## Date and time

* Held during Week 6 during our normal class time: Thursday, February 15 at 6:00 PM GMT
* You will get the link to the midterm ahead of time, but it won't be enabled until 6:00 PM GMT the day of the exam

## Material

* Everything that was covered in weeks 1 - 4 of the class
* This includes lesson material, live classes, practice problems, assignments

## Format

* Administered online using a tool called OnlineExamMaker
* You can prepare and use any amount of notes on paper, but no other resources on the computer or Internet are allowed
* 45 minute exam from the time you begin
* Be sure to start the test between 6:00 - 6:15 PM GMT (it will close after that point)

* We won't be using Zoom during the exam; you can just access the exam individually when you're ready
* Plan to have scratch paper for tracing/diagramming etc.

## Proctoring software

* The exam website is also a proctoring service
* It will ask you to turn your camera on, and will take some pictures at random during the test
* It will flag any activity such as closing the test, changing programs, switching tabs, etc. If you do this too many times, it will close the exam and you will not be able to continue. Once you start the exam, you should expect to stay on the exam page and complete each question without any interruptions or using your computer for anything else.
* It disables copy and paste during the test
* It gives us the option to monitor your activity

## Exam environment

* Plan to be in a test-taking environment
* Quiet, mostly private

## Practice exam

* A practice exam is available [here](https://t.onlineexammaker.com/doexam/G9dLlbEAyDQ.html) so that you can get used to the software and format.
