## Why practice?

Practice coding helps you become a great coder. These practice problems aren't
graded, but that doesn't mean they aren't important.

You should aim to practice a lot, especially with unfamiliar concepts. Spread practice over multiple days to take advantage of the _spacing effect_, which helps you retain new knowledge.

<details><summary>More about practice</summary>

Practice helps you understand what you know, and what you don't know. It can be easy to trick yourself into thinking you understand something when you
do not -- or that you don't understand when you do. Practicing by writing code
or debugging code will help you find out what you really understand, and where
you are still confused.

Practice helps build confidence in your coding. The more programs you write, and
the more problems you solve, the more you learn that you are a capable coder and
problem-solver.

Practice doesn't always feel good - sometimes you'll be stumped! But, practice
shouldn't feel super frustrating either. If you find yourself getting angry at
yourself or the code, it's a good time to take a break and ask for help.

The **solutions** to each challenge are available, and you can view a video of the solution below each challenge.

* Try to go through the whole challenge without using the solution.
* If you can‚Äôt do the challenge without looking the solution, it means you don‚Äôt understand the material well enough yet.
* Try the next practice challenges without looking at the solution. If you need more practice challenges, reach out on Discord.

## 1. Working with linked list references

Consider the following linked list:

<center>
<img
  src="/images/week-06/week-6-practice-1.png"
  alt="A five node linked list holding the string 'hello' with three variables: head, which references the h node; temp, which references the e node; and ref, which references the second l node."
  style="width:500px;" />
</center>

1. What is the value of `temp.next`?
2. What does `temp.next.val` evaluate to?
3. What does `head.next.next == temp` evaluate to?
4. What are some ways we can access the character 'o'?
5. How do the following statements change the diagram?
    1. `temp.next = ref`
    2. `temp = ref.next.next`
    3. `head = head.next`
    4. `ref = None`
