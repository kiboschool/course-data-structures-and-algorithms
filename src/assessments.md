# Assessments & Grading

## Grades

Your grade is composed of the following components:

* Assignments: 50%
* Midterm Project: 20%
* Mock Interviews: 15%
* Quizzes: 15%

## Assignments

During some weeks, you'll be given an assignment to test the new skills and concepts you learned.
The assignments will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will be five assignments overall (weeks 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9).

## Midterm Project

There will be a midterm project. It will be similar to assignments, but may be of broader scope (including concepts across multiple weeks) and more challenging.

The midterm project will span weeks 4 and 5.

## Mock Interviews

Throughout the semester, you will be participating in mock interviews with your peers. As a part of these mock interviews, you will be required to submit code and reflections. More information is available on the [Mock Interviews](interviews.md) page. 

## Quizzes

After each week's material, there will be a short quiz to check that you understand the material. Quizzes will be in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. (No quizzes in weeks 5 or 10).

## Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instuctor. Such requests must be made at least 24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student. Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.

## Academic Integrity

When you turn in an assignment, you are representing that the work is your own.
Copying work from another student or from online and submitting it is _plagiarism_.

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:

- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo
