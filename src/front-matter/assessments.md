# Assessments & Grading

You overall course grade is composed of these weighted elements:

- Assignments: 40%
- Midterm exam: 10%
- Final exam: 25%
- Quizzes: 15%
- Peer interviews: 10%

## Assignments

During some weeks, you'll be given a programming assignment to test the new skills and concepts you've learned. The assignments will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the material and practice problems before you start the assignment each week. The assignments will be due on Sunday nights and will be submitted and graded on Gradescope. There will be five assignments overall.

## Exams

There will be a midterm exam in week 6 of the course and a final exam in week 10 of the course. The exams will be administered online during our regular class meeting time. The exams are timed and are to be completed individually.

## Quizzes

After each week's material, there will be a short quiz on Gradescope to check that you understand the material. There are a total of eight quizzes overall -- in all weeks except weeks 6 and 10. The quizzes must be submitted an hour before our class meeting each week (Thursdays at 5:00 PM GMT).

## Peer Interviews

You will be participating in peer technical interviews. As a part of these peer interviews, you will be required to submit reflections on Gradescope. Peer interview reflections are due on Sunday nights. These interview questions are similar to what you might encounter during coding interviews for software development jobs. Our goal with these questions is to help prepare you
for technical interviews in the software industry.

## Late Policy

Assignments and peer interview reflections can be submitted late under Kibo's late policy:

* Submissions within two weeks of the deadline incur a 10% penalty.
* Submissions beyond two weeks late incur a 20% penalty.

The final submission deadline is the last day of the academic term.

Note that the late policy only applies to assignments and peer interview reflections. Quizzes must be submitted before the live class each week, and no late submissions will be accepted.

Students facing exceptional circumstances in terms of submitting work on time should immediately contact their Kibo advisor.
