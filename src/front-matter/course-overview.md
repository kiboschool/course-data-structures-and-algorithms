## Course Description

This course teaches the fundamentals of data structures and introduces students to the implementation and analysis of
algorithms.

Students start by examining the basic linear data structures: linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues. They learn how
to build these structures from scratch, represent algorithms using pseudo-code, and translate algorithms into running
programs. They apply these algorithms to real-life applications to understand complexity and performance tradeoffs.
Students will also learn how to develop algorithms for sorting and searching, use iteration and recursion for
repetition, and make tradeoffs between the approaches. They will learn to estimate the efficiency of algorithms, and
practice writing and refining algorithms in Python.

This course emphasizes big-picture understanding and practical problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews
and professional practice. Throughout the course, students will solve common practice problems, and participate in peer
interview sessions. As part of their formative assessments, they will also deepen their understanding of these topics
and practice technical communication by writing technical blog posts.

## Topics

- Python Memory Model
- ADTs
- Algorithm Analysis
- Searching and Sorting
- Recursion
- Linked Lists
- Lists, Stacks, and Queues
- Trees

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Answer practice exercises to try out the concepts
- Complete assignments and exams to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to write lots of programs, so that you can
explore the concepts in a variety of ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the practice problems included in the course.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Describe the implementation and performance of fundamental data structures
- Describe underlying data structures upon which more complex structures are built
- Design and analyze recursive algorithms
- Implement several searching and sorting algorithms including insertion-sort, merge-sort and heap-sort
- Solve common algorithmic technical interview problems
